\title{citep - inline parenthetical citation}
\usage{
citep(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a citation query, or list of queries for multiple citations. See details and examples}

\item{...}{additional arguments for the search or formatting. See details.}
}
\value{
Format of the parenthetical citation will depend on configuration. 
  Unless citation_format = "pandoc", formatting is handled by 
  \code{\link[RefManageR]{Citep}}. See the arguments to Citep for details.
  knitcitations will automatically track what has been cited during the
  active R session until the citation log is reset.

\description{
Generate an inline parenthetical citation
}
\details{
the citation query can be any of: 
- A bibentry object, 
- An article or dataset DOI,
- The URL to a website such as a scientific journal article page 
- A path to a PDF file (will attempt to extract citation info)
- A search query string, such as part of the article title, 
  year, or journal (Queries CrossRef)
- The bibkey to anything that has already been cited. 
 knitcitations will attempt to find the most complete citation information
 based on the information specified.  In some cases that information may
 be incomplete.  When using search queries rather than an exact reference
 (such as URL, DOI, pdf, or bibkey) the desired article may not be found or
 many not be uniquely determined by the string. The most relevant search
 result is returned, so consider refining search terms as necessary.
 See examples.
