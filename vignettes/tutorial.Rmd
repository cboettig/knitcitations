`knitcitations` is an R package designed to add dynamic citations to dynamic documents created with [Yihui's knitr package](https://github.com/yihui/knitr).



Installation 
------------

Install the development version directly from Github 

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("knitcitations", "cboettig")
```

Or install the current release from your CRAN mirror with `install.packages("knitcitations")`.  


Quick start: rmarkdown (pandoc) mode
------------------------------------

Start by loading the library.  It is usually good to also clear the bibliographic environment after loading the library, in case any citations are already stored there:  

```{r}
library("knitcitations")
cleanbib()
```

Set pandoc as the default format:

```{r}
options("citation_format" = "pandoc")
```

(Note: The old method will eventually be depricated.  For documents using `knitcitations <= 0.5` it will become necessary to set this as `"compatibility"`).  

### Cite by DOI

Cite an article by DOI and the full citation information is gathered automatically. By default this now generates a citation in pandoc-flavored-markdown format. We use the inline command `citep("10.1890/11-0011.1")` to create this citation `r citep("10.1890/11-0011.1")`.  

An in-text citation is generated with `citet`, such as `citet("10.1098/rspb.2013.1372")` creating the citation to `r citet("10.1098/rspb.2013.1372")`.  


### Cite by URL

Not all the literature we may wish to cite includes DOIs, such as [arXiv](http://arxiv.org) preprints, Wikipedia pages, or other academic blogs.  Even when a DOI is present it is not always trivial to locate.  With version 0.4-0, `knitcitations` can produce citations given any URL using the [Greycite API](http://greycite.knowledgeblog.org). For instance, we can use the call `citep("http://knowledgeblog.org/greycite")` to generate the citation to the Greycite tool `r citep("http://knowledgeblog.org/greycite")`.  

### Cite bibtex and bibentry objects directly 

We can also use `bibentry` objects such as R provides for citing packages (using R's `citation()` function): `citep(citation("knitr")` produces `r citep(citation("knitr"))`.  Note that this package includes citations to three objects, and pandoc correctly avoids duplicating the author names.  In pandoc mode, we can still use traditional pandoc-markdown citations like `@Boettiger2013` which will render as @Boettiger2013 without any R code, provided the citation is already in the `.bib` file we name (see below).


### Re-using Keys

When the citation is called, a key in the format `FirstAuthorsLastName_Year` is automatically created for this citation, so we can now continue to cite this article without remembering the DOI, using the command `citep("Abrams_2012")` creates the citation `r citep("Abrams_2012")` without mistaking it for a new article.  



```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, results="hide"}
## Dummy block to stop R check failing when it tries to tangle and source the vignette
citep(citation("knitr"))
citet("10.1098/rspb.2013.1372")
```


### Displaying the final bibliography

At the end of the document, include a chunk containing the command:

```{r, message=FALSE}
write.bibtex(file="references.bib")
```

Use the chunk option `echo=FALSE` to hide the chunk command.  This creates a Bibtex file with the name given.  [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc) can then be used to compile the markdown into HTML, MS Word, LaTeX, PDF, or many other formats, each with the desired journal styling. Pandoc is now integrated with [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) through the [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) package.  Pandoc appends these references to the end of the markdown document automatically.  In this example, we have added a yaml header to our Rmd file which indicates the name of the bib file being used:

```yaml
---
output: 
  html_document:
    pandoc_args: [
      "--biblio", "references.bib",
      "--csl", "ecology.csl"
      ]
---
```


Then calling `rmarkdown::render("tutorial.Rmd")` from R on the tutorial compiles the output markdown, with references in the format of the ESA journals.
