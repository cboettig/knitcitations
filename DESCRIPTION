Version: 1.0.7
Description: provides the ability to create dynamic citations
    in which the bibliographic information is pulled from the web rather
    than having to be entered into a local database such as bibtex ahead of
    time. The package is primarily aimed at authoring in the R 'markdown'
    format, and can provide outputs for web-based authoring such as linked
    text for inline citations.  Cite using a 'DOI', URL, or
    'bibtex' file key.  See the package URL for details.
